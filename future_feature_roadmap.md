## 🌿 **Git Branching Strategy**

You're absolutely right about branching! Here's a **simple but effective** strategy:

### **Basic Branch Structure:**

```
main (production-ready)
├── develop (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/push-notifications
│   ├── feature/offline-reading
│   ├── feature/social-sharing
│   └── feature/reading-tracker
└── hotfix/bug-fixes
```

### **Workflow Commands:**

#### **1. Create Feature Branch:**
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/push-notifications

# Work on your feature...
# Make commits...

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/push-notifications
```

#### **2. Merge Feature to Develop:**
```bash
# Switch to develop
git checkout develop

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/push-notifications

# Push to GitHub
git push origin develop
```

#### **3. Release to Main:**
```bash
# When ready for release
git checkout main
git merge develop
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin main --tags
```

### **Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fixes  
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - Emergency fixes
- `refactor/code-improvement` - Code refactoring

### **Practical Example:**
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/reading-progress

# Make changes and commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add reading progress indicator"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/reading-progress

# Later, merge to develop when complete
git checkout develop
git merge feature/reading-progress
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Next Features**

**Start with these easy-to-implement features:**

2. **Share Buttons** - Let users share articles easily
